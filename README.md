# SongTag

You can [view this app live here](http://songtagapp.com/). My first client-side heavy web app, which I made in my second year at university. I was trying to learn Backbone.js at the time, but I had to settle for writing the whole thing without any frameworks. Now that I can get my head around such frameworks, I no longer wish to maintain a JavaScript file that has 700+ LOC, so I have released the source code instead.
